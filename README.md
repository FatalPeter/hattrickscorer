# HattrickScorer
Hello everyone, this is the HattrickScorer source code.
In order to setup correctly the tool some actions are required.

## Configuration
1) Create a MySQL database on you host and insert the credentials in the file **engine/database.php**
2) Run the queries in **database.sql** to create the tables required by the tool
3) If you publish the tool online you have to regenerate the **GA4** code and the **Google's API KEYS** for the captcha and insert them in the source code
4) Setup your email setting in **mailer.php**

I don't know if there are any other actions to perform on Hattrick website related to CHPP product, please contact the Game Masters to have answers about mantaing and re-publish the tool.
Enjoy.
